					<header class="major"><h2>About Me</h2></header>
					<div class="row gtr-150">
						<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 left-side">
							<p>I started programming back in 8th grade (2009), editing game files in C++ in order to start a business providing a service to gamers playing Call of Duty MW2 on the XBOX 360. Unfortunately, I didn't know web development at the time to scale my business.
							</p>
							<p>
							Fast forward to today, I have 2 years of experience for a tech consulting firm, doing mostly DevOps work typically using IBM Cloud, IBM mainframes, and associated technologies. Last year, I also operated my own Amazon Seller business (started at April 2020 during start of COVID lockdown) and assisted other companies to grow their Amazon Seller businesses.
							</p>
							<p>
								Throughout my 2 years of experience, I've seen tremendous growth in my skillset, my ability to quickly learn new technologies to fit clients' needs, incorporation of good design patterns and software engineering practices, but overall, I've developed a better ability to finish complete a complex project from A to Z and have gained a better understanding of every aspect of the tech stack.

								At the same time, I am still growing everyday and find new interests and skills to learn. While I love being an engineer and enjoy the ability to create things, Amazon was a very eye opening experience. I was quickly forced to learn more to be successful on Amazon including everything from Marketing and Campaigns, Branding, Product Development and Research, Supply Chain and Inventory Management, just to name a few.
							</p>
							<p>
								Recently, I've taken up a bigger interest in Data Science. While operating my own Amazon business, I realized the power of data analysis to optimize margins, advertising costs, and improve internal processes and generally, to make more informed business decisions. However, I want to take this a step further and learn more complex ML models for analysis and for development.

								I've also seen how IoT goes hand in hand with Data Science + AI. So for instance, one of my passions is health + wellness, and I was thinking about starting a company in this space that features a lineup of health+wellness related smart products. It was inspired by my recent adoption of a fitbit. Fitbit allows you to aggregate the data + gain insights (you can do this with their API but the fitbit premium - paid subscription - does all of this for you + gives you some popular insights like your sleep, exercise, heart rate, and you can view them in ranges, for instance). 

								This company would have a smart watch as well (which would be better w/ better sensors + understanding of the data as it relates to insights) but could also have a smart water bottle which is essentially a normal water bottle, dedicated specifically for water + w/ a simple sensor inside the bottle, you can track your water intake. You can add a smart scale as well to record daily weight measurements (should be done in the morning right after you wake up which will "normalize" results - give less bias in data). The idea of having these products with constraints would be advertised as "smart practices" rather than what it is b/c in the case of the water bottle, only using it for water gives accurate results whereas using it with/for other beverages gives false results. Similarly, measuring weight should only be done in the morning and this should be advertised as a smart practice by simply educating the consumer that your weight can fluctuate 2-3 pounds per day. Many successful startups have adopted this technique in educating their consumers for a better user experience. We can also have an app or the smart watch give notifications to do the weight measurements as well.

								Essentially, this company creates a suite of IoT devices which serves as a platform for data collection. In today's world, we see this being done primarily only with some sort of application that communicates over the web to your device (phone, computer, tablet, etc.). However, as the field of IoT grows, one consideration to keep in mind from an operator's point-of-view is that what you're getting in exchange for the cost to run your business is not only your margins from each device you sell, but the data you can collect + the value from the mining of this data.
